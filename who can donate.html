            <h2>Who Can Donate?</h2>
            <p>All people should consider themselves potential organ, eye, and tissue donors. Your age, race, ethnicity, religion, or health (in most cases) don’t matter.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="info-section">
            <h2>Is There an Age Limit for Organ Donation?</h2>
            <p>You can donate at any age. The health of your organs is more important than your age.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="info-section">
            <h2>Medical Conditions</h2>
            <p>Having an illness or medical condition doesn't necessarily prevent a person from becoming an organ or tissue donor. The decision about whether some or all organs or tissue are suitable for transplant is made by medical specialists at the time of donation, taking into account your medical, travel, and social history.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="info-section">
            <h2>Cancer</h2>
            <p>Someone with current active cancer cannot become an organ donor. However, it may be possible for people with certain types of cancers to donate after three years of treatment. It may also be possible to donate corneas and some tissue in these circumstances.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="info-section">
            <h2>Lifestyle Choices</h2>
            <p>It is still possible to become an organ donor if you smoke. Specialist healthcare professionals decide in each individual case whether a person's organs and tissue are suitable for donation, and smokers and people with other health conditions have saved - and continue to save - lives through organ donation.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="info-section">
            <h2>Tattoos</h2>
            <p>Having a tattoo does not prevent you from becoming an organ donor.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="info-section">
            <h2>Alcohol</h2>
            <p>Drinking alcohol does not prevent you from becoming an organ donor. Although a heavy alcohol intake might affect your ability to donate some organs, specialist healthcare professionals will decide which organs and tissue are suitable for donation on an individual basis.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="info-section">
            <h2>Ethnicity</h2>
            <p>We need donors from all communities and ethnicities. Blood and tissue types need to match for a transplant to be successful, and organs from donors of the same ethnic background as the recipient are more likely to be a close match.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="info-section">
            <h2>Non-Blood Donors</h2>
            <p>If you don’t or can’t give blood you can still be a potential organ donor. There may be specific reasons why it has not been possible to donate blood such as having had a blood transfusion (or blood products) since 1 January 1980. Or there may be reasons why you could not give blood because of your health at the time. Sometimes a simple thing like a cold or medication that you are taking can prevent you from donating blood.</p>
